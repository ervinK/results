raindrops on a window pane  	stillness of a summer rain  
slowly dawn is breaking through  	yet a morning without you  
curtins rustling in the breeze  	im still trapped within my dreams  
finally when darkness falls  	casting shadows on the walls  
sitting near the fireplace  	dying embers warm my face  
in this peaceful solitude  	all the outside world subdued  
in the gloom  	like an angel passing through my room  
half awake in half in dreams  	seeing long forgotten scenes  
now and then become entwined  	playing games within my mind  
playing games within my mind  	like the embers as they die  
like the embers as they die  	love was one prolonged goodbye  
love was one prolonged goodbye  	and it all comes back to me tonight  
in the gloom  	like an angel passing through my room  
i close my eyes  	and my twilight images go by  
all too soon  	like an angel passing through my room  
long awaited darkness falls  	casting shadows on the walls  
sitting near the fireplace  	dying embers warms my face  
in this peaceful solitude  	all the outside world subdued  
in the gloom  	like an angel passing through my room  
half awake and half in dreams  	seeing long forgotten scenes  
now and then become entwined  	playing games within my mind  
playing games within my mind  	like the embers as they die  
like the embers as they die  	love was one prolonged goodbye

in the gloom  	like an angel passing through my room  
i close my eyes  	and my twilight images go by  
all too soon  	like an angel passing through my room
and im watching the late show in my flat all alone  	how i hate to spend the evening on my own  
blowing outside my window as i look around the room  	and it makes me so depressed to see the gloom  
find the end of the rainbow with a fortune to win  	its so different from the world im living in  
i open the window and i gaze into the night  	but theres nothing there to see no one in sight  
theres a gentleness to everything you do  	and its rubbing off on me i feel it too  
when you call me on the phone  	and im feeling so alone  
ive never done that before  	im always givin a little more  
ive never done that before  	im always givin a little more

people i must write to bills i must pay  	but everythings so different when nights on its way  
how i fear the time when shadows start to fall  	sittin here alone and starin at the wall  
youre so free  	thats what everybodys tellin me  
like a puppet with no will at all  	and somebody taught me how to talk  
and somebody taught me how to talk  	how to walk how to fall  
look this way  	just a little smile is what they say  
youre so free  	thats what everybodys tellin me

so let your arms hang down  	and waddle all around  
like a dreadful mighty killer  	a big black wide gorilla  
like a dreadful mighty killer  	a big black wide gorilla  
lay your head on my chest so you hear every beat of my heart  	now theres nothing at all that can keep us apart  
kisses of fire burning burning  	im at the point of no returning  
ive had my share of love affairs and they were nothing compared to this  	oh im riding higher than the sky and there is fire in every kiss  
when you sleep by my side i feel safe and i know i belong  	still its making me scared that my love is so strong  
kisses of fire burning burning  	im at the point of no returning  
ive had my share of love affairs but they were nothing compared to this  	oh im riding higher than the sky and there is fire in every kiss  
kisses of fire burning burning  	im at the point of no returning  
kisses of fire burning burning  	im at the point of no returning  
no more carefree laughter  	silence ever after  
walking through an empty house tears in my eyes  	here is where the story ends this is goodbye  
knowing me knowing you  	its the best i can do  
in these old familiar rooms children would play  	now theres only emptiness nothing to say  
knowing me knowing you  	its the best i can do
i wasnt jealous before we met  	now every woman i see is a potential threat  
but now it isnt true  	now everything is new  
and baby i was stuck  	i still dont know what  
youve done with me  	a grownup woman should never fall so easily  
i feel a kind of fear  	when i dont have you near  
when i dont have you near  	unsatisfied i skip my pride  
unsatisfied i skip my pride  	i beg you dear  
cause everything is new  	and everything is you  
long awaited darkness falls  	casting shadows on the walls  
sitting near the fireplace  	dying embers warm my face  
in this peaceful solitude  	all the outside world subdued  
in the gloom  	like an angel passing through my room  
half awake and half in dreams  	seeing long forgotten scenes  
now and then become entwined  	playing games within my mind  
playing games within my mind  	like the embers as they die  
like the embers as they die  	love was one prolonged goodbye  
love was one prolonged goodbye  	and it all comes back to me tonight  
in the gloom  	like an angel passing through my room  
i close my eyes  	and my twilight images go by  
all too soon  	like an angel passing through my room
and tomorrow there will be another day  	love has its ways  
and tomorrow there will be another day  	love has its ways  
and tomorrow there will be another day  	love has its ways  
now look at that guy hes making me cry  	he leaves everybody and he only says goodbye  
but if i would have to choose i wouldnt let you go  	just give it some more time and you will see our love will grow  
just give it some more time and you will see our love will grow  	darling i know  
we gotta have patience  	love isnt just a sensation  
love isnt just a sensation  	some of the time it gets rough  
some of the time it gets rough  	love isnt easy but it sure is hard enough  
but a few things can be tough  	love isnt easy but it sure is hard enough

this old dirty ceiling seems a little whiter  	when you walked into the room it all got so much brighter  
and the traffic seemed to get a little lighter  	when you came into my life it all got so much brighter  
and i can feel your love anywhere  	maybe even when youre not there  
everything about you is right  	let it glow and let it be bright

but i have a talent a wonderful thing  	cause everyone listens when i start to sing  
im so grateful and proud  	all i want is to sing it out loud  
thank you for the music the songs im singing  	thanks for all the joy theyre bringing  
who can live without it i ask in all honesty  	what would life be  
what would life be  	without a song or a dance what are we  
mother says i was a dancer before i could walk  	she says i began to sing long before i could talk  
but ive often wondered how did it all start  	who found out that nothing can capture a heart

if im sweet tonight  	things look different in the morning light  
im jealous and im proud  	if you hurt my feelings ill cry out loud  
dont you realize  	i may be an angel in disguise  
its lonely to be free  	but im not a mans toy ill never be  
but i do believe in sympathy  	thats me you see  
i cant help my ways  	im just not the girl to hide my face  
theres a special love  	like an eagle flying with a dove  
ill find it in the end  	if i keep on searching but until then  
i must have left my house at eight because i always do  	my train im certain left the station just when it was due  
i must have read the morning paper going into town  	and having gotten through the editorial no doubt i must have frowned  
i must have made my desk around a quarter after nine  	with letters to be read and heaps of papers waiting to be signed  
and still on top of this im pretty sure it must have rained  	the day before you came  
i must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past two  	and at the time i never even noticed i was blue  
i must have kept on dragging through the business of the day  	without really knowing anything i hid a part of me away  
at five i must have left theres no exception to the rule  	a matter of routine ive done it ever since i finished school  
the train back home again  	undoubtedly i must have read the evening paper then  
oh yes im sure my life was well within its usual frame  	the day before you came  
i must have opened my front door at eight oclock or so  	and stopped along the way to buy some chinese food to go  
i must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten  	i need a lot of sleep and so i like to be in bed by then  
i must have read a while  	the latest one by marilyn french or something in that style  
its funny but i had no sense of living without aim  	the day before you came  
and turning out the light  	i must have yawned and cuddled up for yet another night  
and rattling on the roof i must have heard the sound of rain  	the day before you came
i believe your new girl turned you down  	and they say shes pushin you around  
how does it feel i guess it hurts your pride  	tell me my friend how many nights youve cried  
hes clumsy like a clown  	the world is upside down  
the world is upside down  	the king has lost his crown  
was it hard to step down from your throne  	and to know tonight youre all alone  
oh what a shame you really want that girl  	she doesnt care still you just dream of her  
hes clumsy like a clown  	the world is upside down  
the world is upside down  	the king has lost his crown  
hes clumsy like a clown  	the world is upside down  
the world is upside down  	the king has lost his crown
ive seen you twice in a short time  	only a week since we started  
only a week since we started  	it seems to me for every time

would you laugh at me if i said i care for you  	could you feel the same way too  
tell me please cause i have to know  	im a bashful child beginning to grow

in the heat and the snow and in the rain  	came to hear him play  
came to hear him play  	play their minds away  
longed to hear him play  	play their minds away  
so they let him play  	play their minds away  
voices growing louder irritation building  	and im close to fainting  
and now theyve come to take me  	come to break me  
voices growing louder irritation building  	and im close to fainting  
voices growing louder irritation building  	and im close to fainting  
voices growing louder irritation building  	and im close to fainting  
they must know by now im in here trembling  	in a terror ever growing  
you and i can share the silence  	finding comfort together  
and after fights and words of violence  	we make up with each other  
you and i can share the silence  	finding comfort together  
and after fights and words of violence  	we make up with each other  
though its hurting me  	now its history  
nothing more to say  	no more ace to play  
the winner takes it all  	the loser standing small  
beside the victory  	thats my destiny  
thinking i belonged there  	i figured it made sense  
i figured it made sense  	building me a fence  
but i was a fool  	playing by the rules  
the gods may throw a dice  	their minds as cold as ice  
the winner takes it all  	the loser has to fall  
its simple and its plain  	why should i complain  
does it feel the same  	when she calls your name  
but what can i say  	rules must be obeyed  
the judges will decide  	the likes of me abide  
spectators of the show  	always staying low  
the game is on again  	a lover or a friend  
a big thing or a small  	the winner takes it all  
if it makes you feel sad  	and i understand  
and i understand  	youve come to shake my hand  
the winner takes it all  	the winner takes it all

you you used to sleep by my side  	you swore you had nothing to hide  
night night after long endless night  	you swore you had nothing to hide  
you swore you had nothing to hide  	and i was so naive to believe your lies

night night after long endless night  	you swore you had nothing to hide  
you swore you had nothing to hide  	and i was so naive to believe your lies

the book of love that sacred place  	where we walk tall or in disgrace  
who tills the ground on which we tread  	who gives us all our daily bread  
the spirit woken from its sleep  	the demon stirring from the deep  
whose gates at dawn we all must pass  	the last one first the first one last  
whose words must be both black and white  	whose music shall be day and night  
the moon that tells us of the sun  	where voices soar so far above  
where voices soar so far above  	these pages are the book of love  
just come to me  	ill always be right here  
your heart is where i live  	and what you ask is what ill give  
im not afraid of losing you or saying goodbye  	if someone needs you more than me i will understand why  
id never stand between someone whos holding your heart  	but i cant let a superstition tear us apart  
who has the right to speak fire from above  	if heaven is away from you that is the place i will give up  
if heaven is away from you that is the place i will give up  	for falling in love cant be taking these lips from the cup  
dont fill her mind with bread and blood  	dont confuse strength with pride and mud  
dont confuse strength with pride and mud  	i have a faith in love thats thicker than all bread and blood  
im not afraid to face the truth of what i believe  	if love was never meant to choose it could never succeed  
and we may always stand alone in everyones sight  	and be the judge unto ourselves between wrong and right  
and be the judge unto ourselves between wrong and right  	who puts a price on eternitys sin  
dont fill her mind with bread and blood  	dont confuse strength with pride and mud  
dont confuse strength with pride and mud  	i have a faith in love thats thicker than all bread and blood  
dont fill her mind with bread and blood  	dont confuse strength with pride and mud

when all else fails and you have nothing  	you know you really should believe in something  
take a look at what you have  	to a dream thats not all that bad  
dont waste time with all your thinking  	wake up now your dreams are sinking  
its much quicker than the eye  	its you mind and its there all the time  
say goodbye this is tomorrow  	make your mind up not to follow  
you can stay with me now  	and tell me what you know  
and tell me what you know  	you can stay with me now  
you can stay with me now  	and tell me all you know  
and even as i wonder im keeping you in sight  	youre a candle in the window on a cold dark winters night  
youre a candle in the window on a cold dark winters night  	and im getting closer than i ever thought i might  
and if i have to crawl upon the floor  	come crashing through your door  
come crashing through your door  	baby i cant fight this feeling anymore  
cause you take me to the places that alone id never find  	and even as i wonder im keeping you sight  
and even as i wonder im keeping you sight  	youre a candle in the window on a cold dark winters night  
youre a candle in the window on a cold dark winters night  	and im getting closer than i ever thought i might  
and if i have to crawl upon the floor  	come crashing through your door  
come crashing through your door  	baby i cant fight this feeling anymore
and take the leap from bitter sweet  	do you believe do you believe  
do you believe do you believe  	do you still believe  
in the sea of those eyes in the fall of the rise  	there is no compromise  
all of the secret fears inside  	and all the craziness i hide  
and she doesnt judge the man  	she just takes me as i am  
and that love has helped me open a door  	making me love myself a little more  
nothing that anyone can do  	and so she lets me live it through  
and when im in my darkest hour of uncertainty  	she just simply lets me be  
she just simply lets me be  	and goes right on loving me  
everyone says this kind of life you live cannot last  	and you smile as its going past  
each morning arrives and so much is new  	you cant wait to share it all with someone just like you  
the telephone rings and friends come around and talk to the night  	you see the world start to sing and the fire inside you begins  
until you do you live the only life that you know  	and the wild fire lets you go  
hot sun as warm as the kissing of the wind  	fooststeps in perfect time  
hold me this dance is mine  	the dance is mine  
we are alone your love excites me  	you are the earth moving inside me  
feel like dancing with the mountain  	feel the rhythm dancing with the mountain  
your voice as soft as a river running dry  	hold me this dance is mine  
we are alone your loves exciting me  	you are the earth moving inside me  
feel like dancing with the mountain  	feel the rhythm dancing with the mountain  
feel like dancing with the mountain  	feel the rhythm dancing with the mountain  
i should have known before  	her love for me was gone  
daybreak oh daybreak  	i let her walk away  
now i dont know what to do  	so daybreak please break through  
i was the man to turn you on  	and you knew it after all  
you might get mad at yourself  	youre doing your very best  
you still dont say you want somebody else  	you want somebody else  
im giving you just one more chance  	to recompense on my romance  
you still dont say you want somebody else  	you want somebody else  
when winter calls and the wind wont wait  	look through the rain see the leaves start to break  
once so alone like a prayer on the sea  	nothing to hide so much there to see  
the thoughts you wear like a long lost friend  	are buried so deep that you cant see them end  
you know spring will come just as quick as you need  	and run straight to you when the dark nights are freed  
you were late last night the candle burned so low  	and in my darkest hour i knew you had to go  
did he hold you like i held you once before  	is there someone else that loves you even more  
standing face to face the words just fall away  	but in my loneliness i knew just what to say  
did he touch you where i touched you long ago  	please dont answer i dont really want to know  
so dont tell me  	dont tell me  
i have no room to share  	i know the road i follow going nowhere  
should i close my eyes and say im giving up  	can we compromise the darker side of love  
did he hold you like i held you once before  	since i lost your love i need you even more  
i have no room to share  	i know the road i follow going nowhere  
dont tell me  	dont tell me

its magic when you tell me and run your fingers through my hair  	i dont need your persuasion cause im already there  
i dont need your persuasion cause im already there  	ive just read it through and i said to myself  
ive just read it through and i said to myself  	thats not really you ill keep myself to myself  
its magic when you tell me and write the words i want to see  	when i reach the last line its just empty for me  
ive been learning so long about the things you do  	ive been learning so long about you about you  
take me away take me away  	take me away  
do you dream fantasy and believe what you see is weird  	i need a remedy or a book to get off this fear  
thats the end of the line  	thats the end of the line
even the nights are better  	now that were here together  
now that were here together  	even the nights are better  
you you knew just what to do  	cause you had been lonely too  
you did more than mend a broken heart  	cause now youve made a fire start  
even the nights are better  	now that were here together  
now that were here together  	even the nights are better  
even the nights are better  	now that were here together  
now that were here together  	even the nights are better

youre my fantasy youre my reality  	girl youre every woman in the world to me  
girl youre every woman in the world to me  	youre everything i need youre everything to me

girl youre every woman in the world to me  	youre everything i need youre everything to me  
standing on the edge again  	its not too late to try again  
i still believe we can see this through  	theres only so much i can do  
is it saying goodbye  	cause theres nothing as cold as the ashes  
cause theres nothing as cold as the ashes  	when the fire has died  
so much is on the line  	heres a chance to make it right  
theres a hole in my head where the rain comes in  	you took my body and played to win  
ha ha woman its a crying shame  	but you aint got no one else to blame  
rolled in from another town  	hit some gold too hot to settle down  
but a fool and his money soon go separate ways  	and you found a fool lyin in a daze  
ha ha woman what you gonna do  	you destroyed all the virtues that the lord gave you  
its so good that youre feeling pain  	but you better get yourself on board the very next train  
evil woman how you done me wrong  	but now youre tryin to wail a different song  
i came runnin every time you cried  	thought i saw love smilin in your eyes  
truth hidden between the lies  	we both know the chances  
we both know the chances  	nothing comes from compromise  
nothing comes from compromise  	only strength advances  
only strength advances  	i will be here at your side  
with cotton candy clouds  	step inside the rainbow  
step inside the rainbow  	ride where dragonflies sing loud  
paint the ground  	cuckoos calling do i have to go  
the valleys and the fields  	follow me inside the tree  
a long time ago from the valley of the sun  	came the holy power  
came the holy power  	when the gods were one  
this is the hour now is the time  	driven by the purest love i give you mine  
our love has brought us both together  	and its our love that will go on forever  
and its our love that will go on forever  	there is no love that can become as one  
and now our destiny calls  	youll remember it all  
and just when i thought time had set me free  	those thoughts of you keep taunting me  
though each and every part of me has tried  	only you can fill that space inside  
so theres no sense pretending  	my heart its not mending  
ive done everything i can to ease the pain  	but only you can stop the rain  
i just cant live without you  	i miss everything about you  
and i just cant go on without  	go on without  
pictures of you race across my mind  	filling all the space there is to find  
melting loves own ice that lay so frozen  	i give that sacrifice for feeling chosen  
so if i face another day without you next to me  	ill lock you in my mind and wish away the key  
hope springs eternal when youre near  	all the passion reappears  
hope springs eternal through your eyes  	draws me closer to your side  
given back the trust that was so fleeting  	captured by one my heart was seeking  
and in the silence of the night i hold you next to me  	feeling dreams take flight they set the spirit free  
i couldnt hold it  	and it disappeared  
ive lived to learn to hate the blues  	ive lived with everything but you  
to be lyin here with you  	ooh  
you turn a little into stone  	with every night you spend alone  
to be lyin here with you  	ooh  
theres a thousand things to do  	i cant do anything with you  
you can see me look right through  	i dont feel like i used to do  
so come down love me and itll be alright  	the time to bring back love is not tonight  
i never thought id have to say  	that you should leave and go your way  
theres a thousand things to do  	i cant do anything with you  
you can see me look right through  	i dont feel like i used to do  
not in love still not in love with you  	not in love im still not in love with you  
not in love im still not in love with you  	not in love still not in love with you  
tell me why im taking a chance on you  	taking a chance on you  
theres a thousand things to do  	i cant do anything with you  
you can see me look right through  	i dont feel like i used to do  
you can see me look right through  	i dont feel like i use to do  
theres a thousand things to do  	i cant do anything with you  
i have the ring that needs your finger  	i want you always to remember  
i was so lonely here without you  	i was so cold just like a statue  
i can feel your loving touch inside me  	i can hear you whispering you want to stay close to me  
every day and every night  	i never thought your love could feel so right  
i never thought your love could feel so right  	every day and through the night  
every day and through the night  	let me be the one to hold you tight  
i can feel your answer deep inside me  	i can hear you whispering you want to stay close to me  
every day and every night  	i never thought your love could feel so right  
i never thought your love could feel so right  	every day and through the night  
every day and through the night  	let me be the one to hold you tight  
everyday i prayed that i would find a lover  	then i looked into your eyes and i discovered  
something was changing in my life  	turning the darkness into light  
there is not a thing that i would change about you  	and my life was never quite the same without you  
you made the rain clouds go away  	bringing me sunshine everyday  
in your arms you make me warm  	you give me strength to carry on  
to get much better ooh to get much better  	who are we to say theres only one way to read the letter  
its not inspiring its not the right thing  	i cant accept some things  
i dont believe you i dont believe the things you say  	theres another way i can choose to take  
theres another way i can choose to take  	theres another way and its for me to make  
know what to take what decisions to make without thinking  	i cant accept some things  
is it true you are leaving what you believe  	part of you will always be with me  
is it true you are leaving what you believe  	part of you will always be with me  
let me believe that this moment is good for you too  	when you leave its not really all through  
when you leave its not really all through  	does it get to you  
you can have nothing less  	tomorrow i long for the rest  
if it helps me get through one more day  	you know ill be here anyway  
you can have nothing less  	tomorrow i long for the rest  
if it helps me get through one more day  	you know ill be here anyway  
i need to make you mine  	and i want to take what you have to  
and now it seems that every time  	i look into your eyes  
where only we can go  	when you touch me the memories unfold  
and i remember love  	i remember love  
i remember love  	do you remember love  
to reach into your soul  	there is only so far i can go  
remember the times when our world was alive  	and all of the answers were clear  
and all of the answers were clear  	remember the times when our souls would ignite  
remember the times when our souls would ignite  	and passion explodes into fears  
and i remember love  	i remember love  
i remember love  	do you remember love
hard as a diamonds eye  	soft as a last goodbye  
calm as a distant light  	that shines on an island night  
its not too late to tell you  	i know i wanna tell you  
cold as the arctic ice  	hot as a passions rise  
pure as an infants heart  	that beats through the light and dark  
always getting closer  	i wanna hold you closer  
as i hold you tenderly  	my thoughts were real  
my thoughts were real  	and being with you now is the only  
thought thats strong  	its a lonely night and im trying  
oh dont you want baby i know you  	i want you  
stay with me only if your heart is free  	theres no sense if we cant see beyond how we feel  
theres no sense if we cant see beyond how we feel  	honestly how do we know what we need  
honestly how do we know what we need  	what can we believe help me to know this is real  
if i give it all if i give it all away  	we could have it all we could have it all this way  
i should have said what i was thinking  	followed my heart but it was sinking  
broken dreams are never really what they seem  	somewhere in between you can give all your troubles to me  
if i give it all if i give it all away  	we could have it all we could have it all this way  
i should have said what i was thinking  	followed my heart but it was sinking  
when youre dreaming and i hold you  	remember that dream will come true  
when thunder breaks the dawn  	when all muy strength is gone  
when youre dreaming and i hold you  	remember that dream will come true  
we run so far from who we really are  	and we starve and thirst we praise and curse  
till in the end we learn to wait  	and we squeeze the hands of fate  
through the time and space  	ill always see your face  
all last night we lay in bed making love  	i never felt so much before with anyone  
i never felt so much before with anyone  	never had to say a word  
it was all right there  	the warmth inside us flamed and circled everywhere  
im alive  and the world shines for me today  	im alive  suddenly i am here today  
im alive  and the dawn breaks across the sky  	im alive  and the sun rises up so high  
im alive  and the world shines for me today  	im alive  suddenly i am here today  
all my life ive been a manual man  	i like the floor all the power in my hand  
driving up and down the road all day  	overtaking anything in the way  
you know manual is far too old  	to keep pace then he left us cold  
quick thinking and a mutual aim  	so on finding out the name of the game  
so on finding out the name of the game  	a different unit was ordered that day  
a different unit was ordered that day  	who wants to go thru the gears anyway  
the same color the same design  	the same car with a different mind  
knowing now we wouldnt take second place  	both saying with a smile on our face
the man that you tried to free  	is still locked inside of me  
and the money she gave me wasnt enough to pay the rent  	but before i get some all my moneys long been spent  
its nice to get away from all the noise back home  	its harmless in a way we dont have that far to go  
and its nice cause i love you cause i love you cause i love you  	with the rain came freedom never was one more word so true  
with the rain came freedom never was one more word so true  	in the ragged morning then the word came alive in you  
and i tried and i tried for you  	its not easy cause i love you cause i love you cause i love you  
all the food that we could buy wasnt enough to keep just one alive  	but we came through summer letting autumn close your eyes  
and i tried and i tried for you  	i can take it cause i love you cause i love you cause i love you  
but its hard for me  	yes its hard for me  
burnt your fingers before  	burnt your finger before  
i dont know why it seemed so long  	ive got your love its such a total feeling  
ive got your love  	and if i lose all others  
she was tall  	she was lost  
the flame just grew  	talking about just the things we knew  
talking about just the things we knew  	watching a new day arise outside my room  
the more i listened the more she told  	and in fascination my heart was sold  
she was tall  	she was lost  
im not easy to understand  	but you hold out your hand  
you say you want me need me  	love me baby  
im not easy to understand  	but you hold out your hand  
you say you want me need me  	love me baby  
i want to love forever  	to keep our world together  
you say you want me need me  	love me baby  
ill always need a friend  	one i can defend  
all ive got to give  	is do you want to live  
love has brought it on  	and it must go on  
taking what is mine  	just between the lines  
all alone for me to take  	fell in love today

taking what is mine  	just between the lines  
ill always need a friend  	one i can defend  
all ive got to give  	is do you want to live  
taking what is mine  	just between the lines

as long as i live all that i receive is what i want to give to you  	i know that if i can stay for a while you will soon love me too  
it beats hanging round waiting for moments that wait into days  	i dont want to love you in two different ways  
do you want to give do you want to give me you whole day and more  	do you want to give do you want always the key to the door  
love comes to me and leaves me with you  	love runs thru me in all that you do  
oh i dont know i just dont know  	its much too fast for me cant we go slow

out of nothing at all out of nothing at all  	out of nothing at all  
you can take the darkness from the pit of the night  	and turn into a beacon burning endlessly bright  
making love out of nothing at all  	out of nothing at all out of nothing at all  
out of nothing at all out of nothing at all  	out of nothing at all  
out of nothing at all out of nothing at all  	out of nothing at all out of nothing at all
fall upon me take love from me  	nothing is more beautiful to see  
nothing is more beautiful to see  	walk beside me grow inside me  
walk beside me grow inside me  	all i have you gave to me  
love ill help you to see  	the world is ours it used to be  
soon will be a day  	when just a look will be to say  
when just a look will be to say  	lets break away today  
cast my pride away  	and had me born again that very day  
im comin through  	theyre teaching me to tell it to you  
way to be  	its the natural remedy  
its the natural remedy  	with the natural guarantee  
a job thats hard to beat  	looking out for holey feet  
treading softly on the ground  	making waves but not a sound  
way to be  	its the natural remedy  
its the natural remedy  	with the natural guarantee  
so i thought about tomorrow  	and i learned to be alone  
and i learned to be alone  	making friends with shadows  
making friends with shadows  	as they moved around my home  
hoping youll find a way  	to tell me you just cant stay  
you laughed hard at the world i know  	now that the seasons show  
only to show we needed each other  	who needs a reason to love  
you have lots of dreams i know  	now its the close of the show  
its not that easy setting you free  	but thats how its gotta be  
as im watching you go  	theres one thing i want you to know  
when the night gets so long and cold  	and no ones there to hold and youre all alone  
and if you ever find you ever need me someday  	im just a heartbeat away  
saying goodbye isnt saying were through  	just know through it all im still here for you  
all the nights that we shared  	darling you know ill be there  
when the night gets so long and cold  	and no ones there to hold and youre all alone  
and if you ever find you ever need me someday  	you walk to the door with nothing to say  
you walk to the door with nothing to say  	i look in your eyes and you look away  
when the night gets so long and cold  	and no ones there to hold when youre all alone  
and the love that we used to know  	and if you ever find that youre all alone  
when the night gets so long and cold  	and no ones there to hold and youre all alone  
and the love that we used to know  	and if you ever find that youre all alone  
i know that only dreams can share  	i close my eyes and see you there  
yes im a man and just flesh and bone  	but you do not love all my dreams are your home  
we can fly to a bridge across the sky  	where the souls that would always cry  
wishing we were complete  	why are some things so very hard to witness and believe  
yes im a man and just flesh and bone  	but you do not love all my dreams are your home  
we can climb to a bridge across the sky  	where the souls that would always cry  
we can climb to a bridge across the sky  	where the souls that would always cry  
if i hold you now from my point of view  	will you show me how to be close to you  
if theres one thing i must do  	its to say i love you too  
if i had to live my life without you near me  	the days would all be empty  
our dreams are young and we both know  	theyll take us where we want to go  
theyll take us where we want to go  	hold me now touch me now  
nothings gonna change my love for you  	you ought to know by now how much i love you  
one thing you can be sure of  	ill never ask for more than your love  
nothings gonna change my love for you  	you ought to know by now how much i love you  
you ought to know by now how much i love you  	the world may change my whole life through  
the world may change my whole life through  	but nothings gonna change my love for you  
so come with me and share the view  	ill help you see forever too  
when love is new  	and the world is out reaching for you  
now and forever  	remember the words  
learning each day  	that the right time was so far away  
hold me as close  	as love will allow  
o come all ye faithful  	joyful and triumphant  
seems like yesterday my life had begun  	as we went through life trying to make it so much fun  
and i know that im still in love with you  	because youre one that have but that i cant refuse  
now i know that im still in love with you  	because youre one that have but that i cant refuse  
you know and i know  	that you cant live on memories alone  
now i know that im still in love with you  	because youre one that have but that i cant refuse  
old habits die hard old habits die hard  	old habits die hard old habits die hard
i didnt really walk away i had something to explain  	trying to reach you night and day when i did not know your name  
why cant the voice that said hello at the moment of first sight  	whisper the words i need to know speak to me that way tonight  
one step closer forward motion  	one step nearer our destination  
one step nearer our destination  	one step closer forward motion  
one step closer forward motion  	one step nearer our destination  
and then wake up with the words ill always want you to say  	come to me today  
there has to be a place for you and me  	where we can sleep and waters still run deep  
where we can sleep and waters still run deep  	and youre the one that sails into me  
theres only one forever  	it brought us both together  
it brought us both together  	theres only one forever  
long ago that path was chosen  	how could we not fall in love  
theres only one forever  	it brought us both together  
it brought us both together  	theres only one forever  
theres only one forever  	it brought us both together  
it brought us both together  	theres only one forever

we listened to that silent voice  	that haunts you til you just give in  
we drifted close then said goodbyes  	just reading well each others eyes  
just reading well each others eyes  	the world had turned while we stood still  
and in between the right and wrong  	is somewhere that sometimes you can belong  
i tried for it all  	she never heard me call  
she never heard me call  	and now i find the futures gone  
and now i find the futures gone  	the reasons that i had to carry on are gone

as they fall from your open hand  	and vanish upon the land  
many words are spoken when theres nothing to say  	the fall upon the ears of those who dont know the way  
show me how to follow you and ill obey  	teach me how to reach you i cant find my own way  
let me see the light let me be the light  	and so with no warning no last goodbye

absorbed with a delicate thought it is how poetry has indefinite  	sensations to which end music is inessential since the comprehension  
of sweet sound is our most indefinite conception music when combined  	with a pleasurable idea is poetry music without the idea is simply music  
without music or an intriguing idea colour becomes pallor man becomes  	carcase home becomes catacomb and the dead are but for a moment  
carcase home becomes catacomb and the dead are but for a moment  	motionless  
to my amazement  	there stood a raven  
then through the silence  	it spoke that one word  
that i shall hear forever more  	nevermore  
no words can soothe him  	no prayer remove him  
and i must hear for evermore  	quoth the raven nevermore  
one more compromise i wont be making  	one more easy way out i wont be taking  
so many chances dont come twice  	so many eyes are made of ice  
one more substitute i wont be trying  	one more piece of the rock that im not buying  
so many times we stand and fight  	so many reasons cant be right  
too many lonely hearts in the real world  	too many lonely nights in the real world  
too many fools who dont think twice  	too many ways to pay the price  
one more sacrifice i wont be making  	one more golden rule i wont be breaking  
no one to let me state my case  	no one to tell me to my face  
too many lonely hearts in the real world  	too many lonely nights in the real world  
too many lonely nights in the real world  	too many bridges you can burn  
too many bridges you can burn  	too many tables you cant turn  
too many tables you cant turn  	dont wanna live my life in the real world  
too many lonely hearts in the real world  	too many lonely nights in the real world  
too many games that i cant play  	too many windmills in my way

and so we live in lives of fantasy  	and dream of dreams that hold the key  
and dream of dreams that hold the key  	and we follow like sheep  
that leads to thee  	we seek the soul that is not ours to keep  
no one born alone  	no man can turn the tide of fortune on his own  
say there but for the grace of god go i  	go i

were floating in the moonlit sky  	the people far below are sleeping as we fly  
im riding in the midnight blue  	im finding i can fly so high above with you  
the villages go by like dreams  	the rivers and the hills the forests and the streams  
taken by surprise  	nobody down below believes their eyes  
were swimming in the frozen sky  	were drifting over icy mountains floating by  
on an ocean deep  	rousing up a mighty monster from his sleep  
were dancing in the midnight sky  	and everyone who sees us greets us as we fly  
were walking in the air  	were walking in the air
but over in a land thats in my back yard  	theres a people who succeed they dont try hard  
well they found a way to live with ease  	by eating from the bush instead of the trees

apple bush apple tree  	back to eternity  
well over in a corner standing there  	telling my house that they havent a single care

someday like my house youre going to chose too  	if you cut this new path well the old one will do  
and you live with the people who live with ease  	the red apple bush the blue apple tree

the pain and ache  	a heart can take  
but when the memories cling and take you there  	till you no longer care  
from what was to be  	its not like me  
where no love is found  	and im no longer bound  
and im no longer bound  	i can let go now  
if i give my heart to you tonight  	will you still be by my side  
and if i should tell you of the love that i feel  	will you still be there for me  
if i give my heart to you tonight  	will you still be by my side  
if all the earth were mine to hold  	with wealth my only goal  
id spend my gold on selfish things  	without the love that your life brings  
just a little bit more is all id need  	till life was torn from me  
sees the forest in spite of the trees  	your grace provides for me  
if i should walk the streets no place to sleep  	no faith in promises you keep  
id have no way to buy my bread  	with a bottle for my bed  
but if i trust the one who died for me  	who shed his blood to set me free  
if i live my life to trust in you  	your grace will see me through  
feel the sting of tears  	falling on this face youve loved for years
the nights are so lonely and the days pass me by  	true love has faded left me behind  
true love has faded left me behind  	so well just move along and stop wasting time

gone are the love songs that only we knew  	robbed by the cold wind that sings the night through  
robbed by the cold wind that sings the night through  	gone is the sweet love tried but untrue  
its over and my desperate heart is still trying to find some way  	hoping youll stay  
cause its over all over now  	its over all over now
through trials troubles and care  	i know jesus my savior is there  
giving me faith through darkest days  	keeping me on the narrow way

darkness retreats at the touch of your hand  	jesus savior help me to stand  
jesus lived through darkest pain  	rejected by men despising the shame  
man of sorrows acquainted with grief  	he gave his life so we may be free  
darkness retreats at the touch of your hand  	jesus savior help me to stand  
i know that jesus died for me  	canceled my debt at calvary  
rose from the dead unlocked heavens door  	trust in his love and live evermore  
darkness retreats at the touch of your hand  	jesus savior help me to stand

he walked up every step of calvarys rugged way  	and gave his life completely to bring a better day  
i said i wouldnt tell it to a livin soul  	how he brought salvation and he made me whole

of war and peace the truth just twists its curfew gull it glides  	upon four legged forest clouds the cowboy angel rides  
the savage soldier sticks his head in the sand and then complains  	unto the shoeless hunter whos gone deaf but still remains  
unto the shoeless hunter whos gone deaf but still remains  	upon the beach where hound dogs bay at ships with tattooed sails  
the time rusted compass blade aladdin and his lamp  	sits with utopian hermit monks side saddle on the golden calf  
sits with utopian hermit monks side saddle on the golden calf  	and on their promises of paradise you will not hear a laugh  
relationships of ownership they whisper in the wings  	to those condemned to act accordingly and wait for succeeding kings  
to those condemned to act accordingly and wait for succeeding kings  	and i try to harmonize with songs the lonesome sparrow sings  
the motorcycle black madonna twowheeled gypsy queen  	and her silverstudded phantom cause the gray flannel dwarf to scream  
each one wishing for what the other has got  	and the princess and the prince discuss whats real and whats not  
the foreign sun it squints upon a bed that is never mine  	as friends and others strangers from their fates try to resign  
as friends and others strangers from their fates try to resign  	leaving men holy and totally free to do anything they wish to do but die  
do not think about tomorrow  	let tomorrow come and go

words and music by ed mccurdy  	last night i had the strangest dream  
filled with women and men  	and the paper they were signing said  
and the paper they were signing said  	theyd never fight again  
and the people in the streets below  	were dancing round and round

theres nothing here to keep us in this shanty town  	none of us are caring where were bound  
theyre throwing it all away  	nothing more to say

all i do is sit and sigh  	that last long day she said goodbye  
that last long day she said goodbye  	well lawd i thought i would cry  
ive grown so used to you somehow  	but im nobodys sugar daddy now  
some times when the sun goes down  	and im lost in some other town  
my thoughts may drift away  	to manzanillo bay  
and i can see a fisherman  	his days catch iying on the sand  
underneath the palms that sway  	over manzanillo bay  
now im missing your silver moon  	black sands and your blue lagoon  
some day i would like to be  	back next to your shining sea  
drinking rum from a conch shell  	caught up in your magic spell  
some day i would like to go  	back down to mexico  
i remember your fields of cane  	your warm breezes and jungle rains  
your warm breezes and jungle rains  	and watching the children play  
and watching the children play  	over manzanillo bay  
and out in your market square  	the women sing out to sell their wares  
ive got fresh shrimp today  	from manzanillo bay  
and under the spell of night  	the bay reflecting the harbor light  
you can hear the guitar play  	over manzanillo bay  
and if youre thinking about romance  	and youre willing to take a chance  
just pick any small cafe  	in manzanillo bay  
some times when the sun goes down  	and im lost in some other town  
my thoughts may drift away  	to manzanillo bay  
like a dream in the night  	as the snow settles white  
as the snow settles white  	theres a fire burning bright  
and theres a house upon a hill  	that keeps us from the chill  
in the rockies and on the plains  	please dont think that im the last to say  
the sun comes up to meet the dawn  	and theres a day that must go on  
and theres a day that must go on  	theres another night thats gone  
and i could spend all of my days  	and remain each day amazed  
and remain each day amazed  	at the way each day is phrased  
in the rockies and on the plains  	please dont think that im the last to say  
now if you could only see  	i know you would agree  
i know you would agree  	there aint nowhere else to be  
and theres a house upon a hill  	that keeps us from the chill  
in the rockies and on the plains  	and please dont think that im the last to say  
im growing tired of the big city lights  	tired of the glamor tired of the sights  
in all my dreams i am roaming once more  	back to my home on the old river shore  
just me and a friend roamin around  	him a magician and i was a clown  
playin the streets for a dollar a day  	waitin for the right time and a sign to lead the way  
crossed over the border to a mystical land  	sort of unexpected didnt quite understand  
sort of unexpected didnt quite understand  	on a razors edge on a grain of sand  
on a roll of the dice we headed out west  	where the sage and and the spice attracted us  
shadows fell down like a dark groping hand  	saw the teeth of the wolves and the blood of the lambs  
on a turn of the cards i lightened my load  	throwing off fear for the weakness it holds  
that we witnessed near at hand  	on a drifters crusade all over the land  
could it be in the stars in the passing of cars  	at a table in the bar in a turn of the cards  
in a change of your mind in the passing of time  	in a ribbon of rhyme just down the line  
just me and a friend roamin around  	him a magician i was a clown  
playin the streets for a dollar a day  	waitin for the right time and a sign to lead the way
the midnight mist  	now and then i feel so fine  
now and then you turn me on  	now and then you must be gone  
now and then i said  	say so long now and forever then
many lessons i have learned  	and i feel like in those hills  
way down yonder in the indian nation  	ridin my pony on the reservation  
way down yonder in the indian nation  	a cowboys life is my occupation  
but as i sit here today  	many miles i am away  
where the oak and blackjack trees  	kiss the playful prairie breeze  
now as i turn life a page  	to the land of the great osage  
where the black oil rolls and flows  	and the snow white cotton grows  
arise sweet destiny time runs short  	all of your patience has heard their retort  
hear us now for alone we cant seem  	to try to rekindle the patriots dreams  
ah but perhaps too much is being asked of too few  	you and your children with nothing to do  
hear us now for alone we cant seem  	to try to rekindle the patriots dreams  
but i knew him as well as i know my own self  	turn turn turn again  
turn turn turn again  	and he wouldnt harm a life that belonged to someone else  
turn turn to the wind and the rain  	and i played my guitar through the night and through the day

and ice like vinyl on the streets  	cold as silver white as sheets  
and parks and bridges ponds and zoos  	ruddy faces muddy shoes  
and the bluest ink isnt really sky  	and at times i think i would gladly die  
and at times i think i would gladly die  	for a day of sky
i wonder as i wander out under the sky  	how jesus the savior did come for die  
how jesus the savior did come for die  	for poor ornry people like you and like i  
for poor ornry people like you and like i  	i wonder as i wander out under the sky  
with wise men and farmers and shepherds and all  	and high from gods heaven a starlight did fall  
and high from gods heaven a starlight did fall  	and the promise of ages it then did recall  
if jesus had wanted for any wee thing  	a star in the sky or a bird on the wing  
a star in the sky or a bird on the wing  	or all of gods angels in heaven to sing  
or all of gods angels in heaven to sing  	he surely couldve had it cause he was the king  
i wonder as i wander out under the sky  	how jesus the savior did come for die  
how jesus the savior did come for die  	for poor ornry people like you and like i

if a girl isnt pretty  	like a miss atlantic city  
like a miss atlantic city  	all she gets in life is pity  
won a contest or a pageant  	if she hasnt she just never  
she must shine in every detail  	like a ring youre buying retail  
when a girls incidentals  	are no bigger than two lentils  
then to me it doesnt spell  	success  
to have temporary nausea  	do i have to hear a lecture  
do i have to hear a lecture  	such as that  
such as that  	is a nose with deviation

light from the sky is shining through the curtain lace  	i never really meant to stay  
how can i leave this place beside you  	how can i leave you baby leave you  
lord knows its daybreak  	and it feels like heartbreak  
i dont want to leave you  	i dont want to leave you i need you  
looks like its daybreak  	but it feels like its heartache  
i dont want to leave you  	dont make me leave you i need you  
i need you  	dont make me leave you  
i knew nothin bout love she knew everything  	but i sat down beside her on a front porch swing  
but i sat down beside her on a front porch swing  	and wondered what the coming night would bring  
and then she looked at me i heard her softly say  	i know youre young you dont know what to do or say  
i know youre young you dont know what to do or say  	but stay with me until the sun has gone away  
but stay with me until the sun has gone away  	and i will chase the boy in you away  
we sat on the sand and a boy took her hand  	but i saw the sunrise as a man  
the evening breeze caressed the trees tenderly  	the trembling trees embraced the breeze tenderly  
and lost in a sigh were we  	the shore was kissed by sea and mist tenderly  
many men with lofty aims strive for lofty goals  	others play at smaller games being simpler souls  
i am of the latter brand all i want to do  	is to find a spot of land and live there with you  
on a hilltop high you and i  	shiny and new a cottage that two can fill  
our veranda will command a view of meadows green  	the sort of view that seems to want to be seen  
the folks like to be called  	what they have always been called  
you used to do ive got news for you  	your fuse is out the girl is on to you  
ill bet you think you can abuse her and say  	you love her too i remember pain  
you put her through  	but the girl is on to you  
the loser is you she sees through your eyes  	youll soon surmise  
she sees through your eyes  	youll soon surmise  
shell come running back to you  	just like she used to do  
thats why the girl is gone gone gone gone  	gone gone gone gone gone
youve got to give a little take a little  	and let your poor heart break a little  
and let your poor heart break a little  	thats the story of thats the glory of love  
youve got to laugh a little cry a little  	until the clouds roll by a little  
until the clouds roll by a little  	thats the story of thats the glory of love  
youve got to win a little lose a little  	yes and always have the blues a little  
yes and always have the blues a little  	thats the story of thats the glory of love  
thats the story of thats the glory of love  	thats the story of thats the glory of love
let this be the last time let this be the last time  	i have no guts i have no pride  
i have no guts i have no pride  	my heart is weak my love is blind  
my heart is weak my love is blind  	when your game is up ill still be by your side  
when your game is up ill still be by your side  	if you love me at all let this be the last time  
you hurt me so much but i love you forever  	cause when you tear me up you always put me back together  
let this be the last time let this be the last time  	i bite my lip and hold my head up high  
i bite my lip and hold my head up high  	i try my best not to let you see me cry  
i try my best not to let you see me cry  	i can take a joke and you can be unkind  
i can take a joke and you can be unkind  	if you love me at all let this be the last time  
you hurt me so much but i love you forever  	cause when you tear me up you always put me back together  
you hurt me so much but i love you forever  	cause when you tear me up you always put me back together
